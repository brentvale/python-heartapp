# python-heartapp
Exploring Python with Django while rebuilding heart rate app project.

I've previously built a heart rate application with similar heart rate calculation logic.  On [github](https://github.com/brentvale/heartapp), or with a live demo available [online](http://heartapp.herokuapp.com/)
